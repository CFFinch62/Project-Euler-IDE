Problem 39: Integer Right Triangles

If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p ≤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

Hint:
1. For a right triangle with sides a, b, c and perimeter p:
   - a² + b² = c² (Pythagorean theorem)
   - a + b + c = p
   - a < b < c
2. For each perimeter p from 12 to 1000:
   - Find all possible combinations of a, b, c that satisfy both equations
   - Count the number of valid solutions
3. Optimization:
   - a must be less than p/3 (since a < b < c)
   - b must be greater than a and less than (p - a)/2
   - c can be calculated as p - a - b
4. Keep track of the perimeter with the maximum number of solutions
5. Note that the minimum perimeter for a right triangle is 12 (3,4,5)
