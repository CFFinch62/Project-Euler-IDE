Problem 31: Coin Sums

In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:

1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).

It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p

How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

Hint:
1. Use dynamic programming to count combinations
2. Create a table where each cell represents the number of ways to make a certain amount
3. For each coin, update the table by considering how many ways we can make the amount using that coin
4. The final answer will be in the cell representing £2 (200p)
