Problem 78: Coin Partitions

Let p(n) represent the number of different ways in which n coins can be separated into piles. For example, five coins can be separated into piles in exactly seven different ways, so p(5)=7.

Find the least value of n for which p(n) is divisible by one million.

Hint:
1. We need to find smallest n where p(n) is divisible by 1,000,000
2. Strategy:
   - Use partition number recurrence
   - Calculate p(n) modulo 1,000,000
   - Check each value until found
3. Implementation:
   - Use Euler's pentagonal number theorem
   - Keep track of previous partition numbers
   - Handle modular arithmetic carefully
4. Optimization:
   - Only store necessary values
   - Use modular arithmetic throughout
   - Consider mathematical properties
5. Key points:
   - Partition numbers grow very quickly
   - Need modular arithmetic
   - Use generating functions
   - Consider mathematical patterns
