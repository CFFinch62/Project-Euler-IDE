Problem 80: Square Root Digital Expansion

It is well known that if the square root of a natural number is not an integer, then it is irrational. The decimal expansion of such square roots is infinite without any repeating pattern at all.

The square root of two is 1.41421356237309504880..., and the digital sum of the first one hundred decimal digits is 475.

For the first one hundred natural numbers, find the total of all the digital sums of the first one hundred decimal digits for all the irrational square roots.

Hint:
1. We need to sum digits of irrational square roots up to 100 decimal places
2. Strategy:
   - Calculate precise square roots
   - Extract first 100 decimal digits
   - Sum digits for irrational roots
3. Implementation:
   - Use arbitrary precision arithmetic
   - Handle decimal point carefully
   - Skip perfect squares
4. Optimization:
   - Pre-compute perfect squares
   - Use efficient square root algorithm
   - Consider mathematical properties
5. Key points:
   - Need high precision calculation
   - Skip rational square roots
   - Handle decimal expansion carefully
   - Consider numerical stability
