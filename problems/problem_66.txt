Problem 66: Diophantine Equation

Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:

x² – Dy² = 1

For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 649² – 13×180² = 1.

It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is square.

By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the following:

3² – 2×2² = 1
2² – 3×1² = 1
9² – 5×4² = 1
5² – 6×2² = 1
8² – 7×3² = 1

Hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D ≤ 7, the largest x is 9.

Find the value of D ≤ 1000 in minimal solutions of x² – Dy² = 1, for which x is maximized.

Hint:
1. We need to find the value of D that gives the largest minimal solution x
2. Strategy:
   - For each non-square D up to 1000:
     - Find the minimal solution using continued fractions
     - Keep track of the largest x found
3. Implementation:
   - Use continued fraction expansion to find solutions
   - Implement Chakravala method or similar for finding minimal solution
   - Handle large numbers carefully
4. Optimization:
   - Skip perfect squares
   - Use efficient methods for continued fraction calculation
   - Store intermediate results to avoid recalculation
5. Key points:
   - Known as Pell's equation
   - Only consider non-square values of D
   - Need to find minimal solution for each D
   - Want D that gives largest x value
