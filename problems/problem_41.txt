Problem 41: Pandigital Prime

We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once. For example, 2143 is a 4-digit pandigital and is also prime.

What is the largest n-digit pandigital prime that exists?

Hint:
1. A number is pandigital if it uses each digit from 1 to n exactly once
2. Key observations:
   - For n=9: Sum of digits 1+2+...+9 = 45, which is divisible by 3
   - For n=8: Sum of digits 1+2+...+8 = 36, which is divisible by 3
   - For n=7: Sum of digits 1+2+...+7 = 28, which is not divisible by 3
   - Numbers divisible by 3 cannot be prime
3. Therefore, the largest possible pandigital prime must be 7 digits or less
4. Strategy:
   - Start with 7-digit pandigital numbers and work downwards
   - Generate all permutations of digits 1-7
   - Check each permutation for primality
   - Return the first prime found (since we're checking from largest to smallest)
5. Optimization:
   - Use a sieve to pre-compute primes up to the maximum possible value
   - Generate permutations in descending order to find the largest prime faster
   - Skip even numbers and numbers ending in 5
