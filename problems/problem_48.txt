Problem 48: Self Powers

The series, 1¹ + 2² + 3³ + ... + 10¹⁰ = 10405071317.

Find the last ten digits of the series, 1¹ + 2² + 3³ + ... + 1000¹⁰⁰⁰.

Hint:
1. We need to calculate the sum of n^n for n from 1 to 1000 and find the last 10 digits
2. Strategy:
   - Calculate each term n^n
   - Sum all terms
   - Take the last 10 digits of the result
3. Implementation:
   - Use modular arithmetic to keep only the last 10 digits during calculations
   - For each n, calculate n^n mod 10^10
   - Sum the results mod 10^10
4. Optimization:
   - Use fast exponentiation (binary exponentiation) to calculate large powers
   - Keep only the last 10 digits at each step to avoid dealing with very large numbers
5. Key points:
   - Need to handle very large numbers efficiently
   - Only the last 10 digits matter
   - Can use modular arithmetic to simplify calculations
