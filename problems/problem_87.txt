Problem 87: Prime Power Triples

The smallest number expressible as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power is 28. In fact, there are exactly four numbers below fifty that can be expressed in such a way:

28 = 2² + 2³ + 2⁴
33 = 3² + 2³ + 2⁴
49 = 5² + 2³ + 2⁴
47 = 2² + 3³ + 2⁴

How many numbers below fifty million can be expressed as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power?

Hint:
1. We need to count numbers expressible as sum of prime powers
2. Strategy:
   - Generate primes up to limit
   - Calculate all possible combinations
   - Count unique sums
3. Implementation:
   - Use sieve for primes
   - Calculate powers efficiently
   - Store sums in set
4. Optimization:
   - Pre-calculate powers
   - Use early termination
   - Consider mathematical bounds
5. Key points:
   - Need to handle large numbers
   - Consider all prime combinations
   - Track unique sums
   - Use efficient prime generation
