Problem 91: Right Triangles with Integer Coordinates

The points P (x₁, y₁) and Q (x₂, y₂) are plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ.

[Diagram showing points P, Q, and O forming a triangle]

There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is, 0 ≤ x₁, y₁, x₂, y₂ ≤ 2.

Given that 0 ≤ x₁, y₁, x₂, y₂ ≤ 50, how many right triangles can be formed?

Hint:
1. We need to count right triangles formed with integer coordinates
2. Strategy:
   - Consider all possible point pairs
   - Check for right angles
   - Count valid triangles
3. Implementation:
   - Generate coordinate pairs
   - Check angle conditions
   - Avoid duplicate counting
4. Optimization:
   - Use mathematical properties
   - Consider symmetry
   - Skip impossible cases
5. Key points:
   - Points must be distinct
   - Right angle can be at any vertex
   - Consider coordinate bounds
   - Handle special cases
