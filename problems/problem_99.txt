Problem 99: Largest Exponential

Comparing two numbers written in index form like 2^11 and 3^7 is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 2^11 = 2048 < 3^7 = 2187.

However, confirming that 632382^518061 > 519432^525806 would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.

Using base_exp.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.

Hint:
1. We need to compare very large numbers
2. Strategy:
   - Use logarithms for comparison
   - Compare exponents * log(base)
   - Find maximum value
3. Implementation:
   - Read base/exp pairs
   - Calculate logarithms
   - Compare values
   - Track maximum
4. Optimization:
   - Use natural logarithms
   - Avoid direct computation
   - Process line by line
5. Key points:
   - Large number comparison
   - Logarithmic transformation
   - Line number tracking
   - Precision handling
