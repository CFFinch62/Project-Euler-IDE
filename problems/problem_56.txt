Problem 56: Powerful Digit Sum

A googol (10¹⁰⁰) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros; 100¹⁰⁰ is almost unimaginably larger: one followed by two-hundred zeros. Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.

Considering natural numbers of the form, a^b, where a, b < 100, what is the maximum digital sum?

Hint:
1. We need to find the largest sum of digits for numbers of the form a^b where a,b < 100
2. Strategy:
   - Generate all numbers a^b where a,b < 100
   - Calculate the sum of digits for each number
   - Keep track of the maximum sum found
3. Implementation:
   - Use arbitrary-precision arithmetic for large numbers
   - Convert numbers to strings to sum digits
   - Try all combinations of a and b
4. Optimization:
   - Skip a=1 and b=1 as they give trivial results
   - Consider that larger values of a and b tend to give larger sums
   - Use efficient methods for digit sum calculation
5. Key points:
   - Need to handle very large numbers
   - Consider all valid combinations of a and b
   - Look for patterns that might give large digit sums
