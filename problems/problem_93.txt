Problem 93: Arithmetic Expressions

By using each of the digits from the set {1, 2, 3, 4} exactly once, and making use of the four arithmetic operations (+, −, *, /) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer targets.

For example,
8 = (4 * (1 + 3)) / 2
14 = 4 * (3 + 1 / 2)
19 = 4 * (2 + 3) − 1
36 = 3 * 4 * (2 + 1)

Note that concatenations of the digits, like 12 + 34, are not allowed.

Using the set {1, 2, 3, 4}, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different target numbers this way, each of which is between 1 and 36, and 1 is the first unreachable number.

Find the set of four distinct digits, a < b < c < d, for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, 1 to n, can be obtained, giving your answer as a string: abcd.

Hint:
1. We need to find the best digit set
2. Strategy:
   - Try all digit combinations
   - Generate all expressions
   - Find consecutive sequence
3. Implementation:
   - Digit permutation generator
   - Expression evaluator
   - Consecutive sequence finder
4. Optimization:
   - Avoid duplicate expressions
   - Use efficient evaluation
   - Skip invalid combinations
5. Key points:
   - All four operations allowed
   - Parentheses allowed
   - No digit concatenation
   - Find longest consecutive sequence
