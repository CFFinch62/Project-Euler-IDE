Problem 69: Totient Maximum

Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of numbers less than n which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.

n	Relatively Prime	φ(n)	n/φ(n)
2	1	 	1	2
3	1,2	 	2	1.5
4	1,3	 	2	2
5	1,2,3,4	 	4	1.25
6	1,5	 	2	3
7	1,2,3,4,5,6	6	1.1666...
8	1,3,5,7	 	4	2
9	1,2,4,5,7,8	6	1.5
10	1,3,7,9	 	4	2.5

It can be seen that n=6 produces a maximum n/φ(n) for n ≤ 10.

Find the value of n ≤ 1,000,000 for which n/φ(n) is a maximum.

Hint:
1. We need to find n that maximizes n/φ(n) up to one million
2. Strategy:
   - Calculate φ(n) for each number
   - Calculate n/φ(n) ratio
   - Keep track of maximum ratio and corresponding n
3. Implementation:
   - Use Euler's product formula for φ(n)
   - Generate prime factors efficiently
   - Handle large numbers carefully
4. Optimization:
   - Use sieve to find prime factors
   - Consider that n/φ(n) is maximized when n has many prime factors
   - Look for patterns in the ratios
5. Key points:
   - φ(n) counts numbers coprime to n
   - n/φ(n) ratio is key
   - Need efficient prime factorization
   - Consider mathematical properties of the ratio
