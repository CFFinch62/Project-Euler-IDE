Problem 47: Distinct Primes Factors

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

14 = 2 × 7
15 = 3 × 5

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

644 = 2² × 7 × 23
645 = 3 × 5 × 43
646 = 2 × 17 × 19

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each. What is the first of these numbers?

Hint:
1. We need to find four consecutive numbers that each have exactly four distinct prime factors
2. Strategy:
   - Generate numbers in order
   - For each number, count its distinct prime factors
   - Check if the next three numbers also have exactly four distinct prime factors
3. Implementation:
   - Use a sieve to pre-compute the number of distinct prime factors for each number
   - For each number, check if it and the next three numbers have exactly four distinct prime factors
4. Optimization:
   - Use a modified sieve of Eratosthenes to count distinct prime factors
   - Skip numbers that can't be part of the sequence (e.g., numbers with fewer than 4 prime factors)
5. Key points:
   - Need to count distinct prime factors, not total prime factors
   - The numbers must be consecutive
   - Each number must have exactly four distinct prime factors
