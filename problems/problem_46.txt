Problem 46: Goldbach's Other Conjecture

It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

9 = 7 + 2×1²
15 = 7 + 2×2²
21 = 3 + 2×3²
25 = 7 + 2×3²
27 = 19 + 2×2²
33 = 31 + 2×1²

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?

Hint:
1. We need to find the smallest odd composite number that breaks Goldbach's conjecture
2. Strategy:
   - Generate odd composite numbers in order
   - For each number, try to express it as prime + 2×square
   - Find the first number that cannot be expressed this way
3. Implementation:
   - Generate odd composite numbers (odd numbers > 1 that are not prime)
   - For each composite number:
     - Try all primes less than the number
     - For each prime, check if (number - prime) is twice a square
   - Return the first number where no such combination exists
4. Optimization:
   - Pre-compute primes up to a reasonable limit
   - Use a set for prime lookups
   - Check squares up to sqrt((number-2)/2)
5. Key points:
   - Start checking from 9 (the first odd composite)
   - Need to check all primes less than the number
   - Need to check all squares up to a certain limit
   - The answer is the first number that fails all combinations
