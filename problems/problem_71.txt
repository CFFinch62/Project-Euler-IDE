Problem 71: Ordered Fractions

Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get:

1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8

It can be seen that 2/5 is the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.

By listing the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 1,000,000 in ascending order, find the numerator of the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.

Hint:
1. We need to find the largest fraction less than 3/7 with denominator ≤ 1,000,000
2. Strategy:
   - Don't need to generate all fractions
   - Use properties of Farey sequences
   - Focus on fractions close to 3/7
3. Implementation:
   - Consider fractions of form n/d where d ≤ 1,000,000
   - Compare each fraction to 3/7
   - Keep track of largest fraction less than 3/7
4. Optimization:
   - Use binary search approach
   - Consider only denominators that could give close results
   - Use properties of continued fractions
5. Key points:
   - Need reduced proper fractions
   - Must be less than 3/7
   - Want largest such fraction
   - Consider mathematical properties of neighboring fractions
