Problem 97: Large Non-Mersenne Prime

The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered in 1999, and is a Mersenne prime of the form 2^6972593−1; it contains exactly 2,098,960 digits. Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the form 2^p−1, have been found which contain more digits.

However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains 2,357,207 digits: 28433×2^7830457+1.

Find the last ten digits of this prime number.

Hint:
1. We need to find last 10 digits of a large number
2. Strategy:
   - Calculate 2^7830457
   - Multiply by 28433
   - Add 1
   - Extract last 10 digits
3. Implementation:
   - Use modular arithmetic
   - Implement efficient exponentiation
   - Handle large numbers
4. Optimization:
   - Use binary exponentiation
   - Work modulo 10^10
   - Avoid full number calculation
5. Key points:
   - Last 10 digits only
   - Non-Mersenne prime
   - Large exponent
   - Modular arithmetic
