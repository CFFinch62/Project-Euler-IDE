Problem 30: Digit Fifth Powers

Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

1634 = 1⁴ + 6⁴ + 3⁴ + 4⁴
8208 = 8⁴ + 2⁴ + 0⁴ + 8⁴
9474 = 9⁴ + 4⁴ + 7⁴ + 4⁴

As 1 = 1⁴ is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.

Hint:
1. Determine the upper bound for the search
2. For each number, calculate the sum of its digits raised to the fifth power
3. Check if the sum equals the original number
4. Sum all such numbers
