Problem 49: Prime Permutations

The arithmetic sequence, 1487, 4817, 8147, in which each of the terms increases by 3330, is unusual in two ways: (i) each of the three terms are prime, and (ii) each of the 4-digit numbers are permutations of one another.

There are no arithmetic sequences made up of three 1-, 2-, or 3-digit primes, exhibiting this property, but there is one other 4-digit increasing sequence.

What 12-digit number do you form by concatenating the three terms in this sequence?

Hint:
1. We need to find a 4-digit arithmetic sequence of primes that are permutations of each other
2. Strategy:
   - Generate all 4-digit primes
   - For each prime, generate all its permutations
   - Check if any three permutations form an arithmetic sequence
3. Implementation:
   - Use a sieve to generate all 4-digit primes
   - For each prime, generate its permutations
   - Check if any three permutations form an arithmetic sequence
4. Optimization:
   - Skip primes that can't be part of the sequence (e.g., primes with repeated digits)
   - Only check permutations that are also prime
   - Check for arithmetic sequences among the prime permutations
5. Key points:
   - All three numbers must be prime
   - All three numbers must be permutations of each other
   - The numbers must form an arithmetic sequence
   - The sequence must be different from 1487, 4817, 8147
