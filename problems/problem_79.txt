Problem 79: Passcode Derivation

A common security method used for online banking is to ask the user for three random characters from a passcode. For example, if the passcode was 531278, they may ask for the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th characters; the expected reply would be: 317.

The text file, keylog.txt, contains fifty successful login attempts.

Given that the three characters are always asked for in order, analyse the file to determine the shortest possible secret passcode.

Hint:
1. We need to find the shortest passcode that satisfies all login attempts
2. Strategy:
   - Analyze order of digits in each attempt
   - Build dependency graph
   - Find valid ordering of digits
3. Implementation:
   - Read and parse login attempts
   - Create directed graph of digit order
   - Find topological sort
4. Optimization:
   - Remove duplicate attempts
   - Consider only used digits
   - Use efficient graph representation
5. Key points:
   - Digits must appear in correct order
   - Some digits may be unused
   - Consider relative positions
   - Need shortest valid solution
