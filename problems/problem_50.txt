Problem 50: Consecutive Prime Sum

The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:

41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13

This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.

The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.

Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?

Hint:
1. We need to find the prime below one million that can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes
2. Strategy:
   - Generate all primes below one million
   - For each starting prime, sum consecutive primes until the sum exceeds one million
   - Check if the sum is prime and keep track of the longest sequence
3. Implementation:
   - Use a sieve to generate all primes below one million
   - Use a sliding window approach to find consecutive prime sums
   - Check if each sum is prime
4. Optimization:
   - Pre-compute all primes below one million
   - Use a set for prime lookups
   - Stop when the sum exceeds one million
   - Keep track of the longest sequence found
5. Key points:
   - The sum must be prime
   - The primes must be consecutive
   - The sum must be below one million
   - We want the prime with the longest sequence
