Problem 58: Spiral Primes

Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

37 36 35 34 33 32 31
38 17 16 15 14 13 30
39 18  5  4  3 12 29
40 19  6  1  2 11 28
41 20  7  8  9 10 27
42 21 22 23 24 25 26
43 44 45 46 47 48 49

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 would be formed. If this process were continued, what would be the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

Hint:
1. We need to find when the ratio of primes on the diagonals falls below 10%
2. Strategy:
   - Generate diagonal numbers for each layer
   - Count how many are prime
   - Calculate the ratio after each layer
3. Implementation:
   - Generate diagonal numbers using the pattern
   - Use a primality test for each diagonal number
   - Keep track of total numbers and prime count
4. Optimization:
   - Use efficient primality testing
   - Only test the new diagonal numbers in each layer
   - Stop when ratio falls below 10%
5. Key points:
   - Each layer adds 4 new diagonal numbers
   - Need to track both total count and prime count
   - Look for patterns in diagonal numbers
