Problem 83: Path Sum: Four Ways

NOTE: This problem is a significantly more difficult version of Problem 81.

In the 5 by 5 matrix below, the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom right, by moving left, right, up, and down, is indicated in bold red and is equal to 2297.

[Matrix shown with path highlighted]

Find the minimal path sum from the top left to the bottom right by moving left, right, up, and down in matrix.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 31K text file containing an 80 by 80 matrix.

Hint:
1. We need to find minimal path sum in 80x80 matrix with all movement options
2. Strategy:
   - Use Dijkstra's algorithm
   - Consider all possible movements
   - Track minimum path to each cell
3. Implementation:
   - Read matrix from file
   - Create priority queue
   - Update distances considering all moves
4. Optimization:
   - Use efficient priority queue
   - Consider grid structure
   - Store only necessary information
5. Key points:
   - Can move in all four directions
   - Need to handle cycles
   - Consider efficient path finding
   - Use appropriate data structures
