Problem 76: Counting Summations

It is possible to write five as a sum in exactly six different ways:

4 + 1
3 + 2
3 + 1 + 1
2 + 2 + 1
2 + 1 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1

How many different ways can one hundred be written as a sum of at least two positive integers?

Hint:
1. We need to count all possible sums of integers that equal 100
2. Strategy:
   - Use dynamic programming approach
   - Build up from smaller sums
   - Consider partition theory
3. Implementation:
   - Create array to store number of ways
   - Fill array using recurrence relation
   - Handle base cases carefully
4. Optimization:
   - Use efficient partition algorithm
   - Store only necessary values
   - Consider mathematical shortcuts
5. Key points:
   - Must use at least two numbers
   - Order matters in partitions
   - Consider using generating functions
   - Handle large numbers efficiently
