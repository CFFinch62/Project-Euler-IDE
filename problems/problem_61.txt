Problem 61: Cyclical Figurate Numbers

Triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal numbers are all figurate (polygonal) numbers and are generated by the following formulae:

Triangle	 	P3,n=n(n+1)/2	 	1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...
Square	 	P4,n=n²	 	1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
Pentagonal	 	P5,n=n(3n−1)/2	 	1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...
Hexagonal	 	P6,n=n(2n−1)	 	1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...
Heptagonal	 	P7,n=n(5n−3)/2	 	1, 7, 18, 34, 55, ...
Octagonal	 	P8,n=n(3n−2)	 	1, 8, 21, 40, 65, ...

The ordered set of three 4-digit numbers: 8128, 2882, 8281, has three interesting properties:
1. The set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the first two digits of the next number (including the last number with the first).
2. Each polygonal type: triangle (P3,127=8128), square (P4,91=8281), and pentagonal (P5,44=2882), is represented by a different number in the set.
3. This is the only set of 4-digit numbers with this property.

Find the sum of the only ordered set of six 4-digit numbers for which each polygonal type: triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal, is represented by a different number in the set, and the set is cyclic.

Hint:
1. We need to find six 4-digit numbers that form a cyclic set and represent different figurate numbers
2. Strategy:
   - Generate all 4-digit figurate numbers for each type
   - Find numbers that can be connected cyclically
   - Check if a complete cycle of six numbers exists
3. Implementation:
   - Create functions to generate each type of figurate number
   - Build a graph of numbers that can be connected
   - Use backtracking to find valid cycles
4. Optimization:
   - Pre-compute all 4-digit figurate numbers
   - Store numbers in sets for quick lookup
   - Use adjacency lists for number connections
5. Key points:
   - Numbers must be 4 digits
   - Last two digits of each number must match first two of next
   - Each number must be a different figurate type
   - The set must be cyclic
