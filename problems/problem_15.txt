Problem 15: Lattice Paths

Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

Hint:
1. This is a combinatorics problem
2. For an n×n grid, the number of paths is the central binomial coefficient C(2n, n)
3. Consider using dynamic programming or mathematical formula
4. Be careful with large numbers and integer overflow
