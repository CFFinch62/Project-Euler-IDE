Problem 37: Truncatable Primes

The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left: 3797, 379, 37, and 3.

Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to right and right to left.

NOTE: 2, 3, 5, and 7 are not considered to be truncatable primes.

Hint:
1. Generate primes using the Sieve of Eratosthenes
2. For each prime, check if it is truncatable from both left and right
3. To check truncatability:
   - Remove digits from left to right and check if all resulting numbers are prime
   - Remove digits from right to left and check if all resulting numbers are prime
4. Sum all primes that are truncatable from both sides
5. Note that truncatable primes cannot contain even digits (except 2) or 5
