Problem 44: Pentagon Numbers

Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, Pn=n(3n−1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:

1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...

It can be seen that P4 + P7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P8. However, their difference, 70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, Pj and Pk, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |Pk − Pj| is minimized; what is the value of D?

Hint:
1. Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula Pn = n(3n-1)/2
2. We need to find two pentagonal numbers Pj and Pk where:
   - Pj + Pk is pentagonal
   - |Pk - Pj| is pentagonal
   - |Pk - Pj| is minimized
3. Strategy:
   - Generate pentagonal numbers in order
   - For each new pentagonal number, check it against all previous numbers
   - Check if both sum and difference are pentagonal
4. Optimization:
   - Use a set to store pentagonal numbers for O(1) lookup
   - Stop when the difference between consecutive pentagonal numbers exceeds the current minimum difference
   - Use the quadratic formula to check if a number is pentagonal
5. Implementation:
   - Generate pentagonal numbers using the formula
   - Store them in a set for quick lookup
   - For each new number, check all previous numbers
   - Keep track of the minimum valid difference found
