Problem 60: Prime Pair Sets

The primes 3, 7, 109, and 673, are quite remarkable. By taking any two primes and concatenating them in any order the result is always prime. For example, taking 7 and 109, both 7109 and 1097 are prime. The sum of these four primes, 792, represents the lowest sum for a set of four primes with this property.

Find the lowest sum for a set of five primes for which any two primes concatenate to produce another prime.

Hint:
1. We need to find five primes that can be concatenated in any order to form primes
2. Strategy:
   - Generate primes up to a reasonable limit
   - For each prime, find other primes that satisfy the concatenation property
   - Find sets of five primes that all work together
3. Implementation:
   - Use a sieve to generate primes
   - Create a function to check if two primes are "compatible"
   - Use a graph-like approach to find sets of five compatible primes
4. Optimization:
   - Pre-compute prime pairs that work together
   - Use a set for prime lookups
   - Start with smaller primes and work up
   - Cache results of primality tests
5. Key points:
   - All concatenations must be prime
   - Need to check both orders of concatenation
   - Want the set with the lowest sum
   - Need efficient primality testing for large numbers
