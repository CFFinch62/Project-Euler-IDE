Problem 40: Champernowne's Constant

An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:

0.123456789101112131415161718192021...

It can be seen that the 12th digit of the fractional part is 1.

If dn represents the nth digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.

d1 × d10 × d100 × d1000 × d10000 × d100000 × d1000000

Hint:
1. The Champernowne's constant is formed by concatenating all positive integers in order
2. To find the nth digit:
   - First determine which number range contains the nth digit
   - 1-digit numbers: 1-9 (9 digits)
   - 2-digit numbers: 10-99 (180 digits)
   - 3-digit numbers: 100-999 (2700 digits)
   - And so on...
3. For each target position (1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000):
   - Calculate which number contains that digit
   - Extract the specific digit from that number
4. Multiply all the found digits together
5. Optimization:
   - Pre-calculate the ranges and their digit counts
   - Use integer division to find the exact number containing the target digit
