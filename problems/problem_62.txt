Problem 62: Cubic Permutations

The cube, 41063625 (345³), can be permuted to produce two other cubes: 56623104 (384³) and 66430125 (405³). In fact, 41063625 is the smallest cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube.

Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits are cube.

Hint:
1. We need to find the smallest cube that has exactly five permutations that are also cubes
2. Strategy:
   - Generate cubes in order
   - For each cube, find all its digit permutations
   - Check which permutations are also perfect cubes
3. Implementation:
   - Generate cubes by cubing consecutive integers
   - Sort digits of each cube to create a signature
   - Group cubes by their digit signatures
4. Optimization:
   - Use a dictionary to group cubes by sorted digits
   - Only store the smallest cube for each permutation group
   - Stop when a group with exactly five cubes is found
5. Key points:
   - Need to handle large numbers
   - All permutations must be perfect cubes
   - Want exactly five permutations
   - Need the smallest such cube
