Problem 32: Pandigital Products

We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

Hint:
1. Consider all possible combinations of multiplicand and multiplier lengths
2. For each combination, check if the product and the concatenation of all three numbers is pandigital
3. Store unique products to avoid duplicates
4. Sum all unique products to get the final answer
