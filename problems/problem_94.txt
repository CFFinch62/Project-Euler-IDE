Problem 94: Almost Equilateral Triangles

It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral length sides and integral area. However, the almost equilateral triangle 5-5-6 has an area of 12 square units.

We shall define an almost equilateral triangle to be a triangle for which two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit.

Find the sum of the perimeters of all almost equilateral triangles with integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed one billion (1,000,000,000).

Hint:
1. We need to find almost equilateral triangles
2. Strategy:
   - Generate Heronian triangles
   - Check almost equilateral condition
   - Sum perimeters under limit
3. Implementation:
   - Triangle generator
   - Area calculator
   - Perimeter checker
4. Optimization:
   - Use parametric formulas
   - Skip non-integral areas
   - Efficient perimeter calculation
5. Key points:
   - Two sides equal
   - Third side differs by 1
   - Integral area required
   - Perimeter limit: 1 billion
