Problem 52: Permuted Multiples

It can be seen that the number, 125874, and its double, 251748, contain exactly the same digits, but in a different order.

Find the smallest positive integer, x, such that 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x, contain the same digits.

Hint:
1. We need to find the smallest number x where x, 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x, and 6x are all permutations of each other
2. Strategy:
   - Generate numbers in order
   - For each number, multiply by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
   - Check if all results are permutations of the original number
3. Implementation:
   - Convert numbers to strings and sort the digits
   - Compare the sorted digits of x with its multiples
   - Return the first number where all multiples are permutations
4. Optimization:
   - Skip numbers that can't satisfy the condition
   - Consider the number of digits (must be same for all multiples)
   - Check if the sorted digits match for all multiples
5. Key points:
   - All multiples must have the same digits as the original number
   - The digits can be in any order
   - We want the smallest such number
