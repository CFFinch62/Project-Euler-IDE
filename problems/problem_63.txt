Problem 63: Powerful Digit Counts

The 5-digit number, 16807=7⁵, is also a fifth power. Similarly, the 9-digit number, 134217728=8⁹, is a ninth power.

How many n-digit positive integers exist which are also an nth power?

Hint:
1. We need to count numbers that have the same number of digits as their power
2. Strategy:
   - For each base (1-9), find powers that have the correct number of digits
   - Count all such numbers
3. Implementation:
   - For each base number:
     - Calculate powers until the digit count exceeds the power
     - Count cases where digit count equals power
4. Optimization:
   - Only need to check bases 1-9 (10^n always has n+1 digits)
   - Can use logarithms to find digit counts
   - Stop when digit count exceeds power
5. Key points:
   - Need to handle large numbers
   - Number of digits must equal the power
   - Consider the relationship between base size and digit count
   - Base 10 and higher can't work (too many digits)
