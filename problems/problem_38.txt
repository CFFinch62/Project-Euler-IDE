Problem 38: Pandigital Multiples

Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:

192 × 1 = 192
192 × 2 = 384
192 × 3 = 576

By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)

The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).

What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , n) where n > 1?

Hint:
1. The number must be a 9-digit pandigital number
2. The base number must be such that when multiplied by 1, 2, ..., n and concatenated, it forms a 9-digit number
3. The base number must be less than 10000 (since 10000 × 1 × 2 = 20000, which would require at least 10 digits when concatenated)
4. For each potential base number:
   - Multiply by 1, 2, ..., n until the concatenated result has 9 digits
   - Check if the result is pandigital
   - Keep track of the largest pandigital number found
5. Note that the base number must be such that the concatenated product is exactly 9 digits
