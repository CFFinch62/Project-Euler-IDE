Problem 9: Special Pythagorean Triplet

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
a² + b² = c²

For example, 3² + 4² = 5².

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.

Hint:
1. Find three numbers a, b, c where a < b < c
2. Check if they satisfy a² + b² = c²
3. Check if a + b + c = 1000
4. Return the product a × b × c
