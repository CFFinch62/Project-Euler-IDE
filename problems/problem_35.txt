Problem 35: Circular Primes

The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.

There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.

How many circular primes are there below one million?

Hint:
1. Generate all primes below one million using the Sieve of Eratosthenes
2. For each prime, generate all its rotations
3. Check if all rotations are prime
4. Count the number of primes where all rotations are also prime
5. Note that primes containing any even digits (except 2) or 5 can be skipped as their rotations will not be prime
