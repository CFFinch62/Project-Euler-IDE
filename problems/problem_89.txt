Problem 89: Roman Numerals

For a number written in Roman numerals to be considered valid there are basic rules which must be followed. Even though the rules allow some numbers to be expressed in more than one way there is always a "best" way of writing a particular number.

For example, it would appear that there are at least six ways of writing the number sixteen:

IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
VIIIIIIIIIII
VVIIIIII
XIIIIII
VVVI
XVI

However, according to the rules only XIIIIII and XVI are valid, and the last example is considered to be the most efficient, as it uses the least number of numerals.

The 11K text file, roman.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains one thousand numbers written in valid, but not necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; that is, they are arranged in descending units and obey the subtractive pair rule (see About Roman Numerals... for the definitive rules for this problem).

Find the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their minimal form.

Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no more than four consecutive identical units.

Hint:
1. We need to convert Roman numerals to minimal form and count saved characters
2. Strategy:
   - Parse Roman numerals
   - Convert to decimal
   - Convert back to minimal form
3. Implementation:
   - Read and parse file
   - Handle Roman numeral rules
   - Calculate character savings
4. Optimization:
   - Use efficient conversion
   - Consider numeral patterns
   - Store conversion rules
5. Key points:
   - Follow Roman numeral rules
   - Find minimal representation
   - Count character differences
   - Handle all valid forms
