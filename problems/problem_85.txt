Problem 85: Counting Rectangles

By counting carefully it can be seen that a rectangular grid measuring 3 by 2 contains eighteen rectangles:

Although there exists no rectangular grid that contains exactly two million rectangles, find the area of the grid with the nearest solution.

Hint:
1. We need to find grid dimensions that give closest to 2 million rectangles
2. Strategy:
   - Calculate number of rectangles in grid
   - Search for dimensions near target
   - Find closest match
3. Implementation:
   - Use formula for rectangle count
   - Search efficiently through dimensions
   - Track closest solution
4. Optimization:
   - Use mathematical properties
   - Consider symmetry
   - Narrow search space
5. Key points:
   - Formula for rectangle count
   - Need to find closest match
   - Consider grid dimensions
   - Handle large numbers
