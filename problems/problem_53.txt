Problem 53: Combinatoric Selections

There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, C(n,r) = n!/(r!(n-r)!), where r ≤ n, n! = n×(n−1)×...×3×2×1, and 0! = 1.

It is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: C(23,10) = 1144066.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of C(n,r) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, are greater than one-million?

Hint:
1. We need to count how many combinations C(n,r) exceed one million for n from 1 to 100
2. Strategy:
   - Calculate C(n,r) for all n from 1 to 100 and r from 0 to n
   - Count how many values exceed one million
3. Implementation:
   - Use dynamic programming to compute combinations
   - Use logarithms to avoid overflow with large numbers
   - Compare with log(1000000) instead of 1000000
4. Optimization:
   - Use symmetry: C(n,r) = C(n,n-r)
   - Stop when C(n,r) exceeds one million
   - Use memoization to store computed values
5. Key points:
   - Need to handle large numbers
   - Consider all valid combinations
   - Count only values exceeding one million
