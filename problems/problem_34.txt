Problem 34: Digit Factorials

145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

Note: As 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

Hint:
1. Precompute factorials for digits 0-9
2. Determine an upper bound for the search (since 9! * 7 = 2540160, and 9! * 8 = 2903040, which is a 7-digit number)
3. For each number up to the upper bound, calculate the sum of factorials of its digits
4. Check if the sum equals the original number
5. Sum all such numbers
