Problem 92: Square Digit Chains

A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.

For example,
44 → 32 → 13 → 10 → 1 → 1
85 → 89 → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → 89

Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.

How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?

Hint:
1. We need to count numbers that end in 89
2. Strategy:
   - Process each number
   - Follow chain until 1 or 89
   - Count 89 results
3. Implementation:
   - Square digit sum function
   - Chain following
   - Memoization
4. Optimization:
   - Cache results
   - Skip processed numbers
   - Use efficient digit extraction
5. Key points:
   - All numbers end in 1 or 89
   - Chain length varies
   - Need efficient processing
   - Handle large numbers
