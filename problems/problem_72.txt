Problem 72: Counting Fractions

Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get:

1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8

It can be seen that there are 21 elements in this set.

How many elements would be contained in the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 1,000,000?

Hint:
1. We need to count all reduced proper fractions with denominator ≤ 1,000,000
2. Strategy:
   - For each denominator, count numbers relatively prime to it
   - Sum all these counts
   - Use Euler's totient function
3. Implementation:
   - Calculate φ(n) for each denominator
   - Sum φ(n) for n from 2 to 1,000,000
   - Handle large numbers carefully
4. Optimization:
   - Use sieve method to calculate totients
   - Calculate totients in batches
   - Consider mathematical patterns
5. Key points:
   - Each φ(d) counts numbers relatively prime to d
   - Need to sum all φ(d) values
   - Must handle large numbers efficiently
   - Consider using modular arithmetic
