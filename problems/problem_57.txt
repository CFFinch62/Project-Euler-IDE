Problem 57: Square Root Convergents

It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction.

âˆš 2 = 1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + ... ))) = 1.414213...

By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:

1 + 1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5
1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4
1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2)) = 17/12 = 1.41666...
1 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/(2 + 1/2))) = 41/29 = 1.41379...

The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth expansion, 1393/985, is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.

In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than the denominator?

Hint:
1. We need to count how many fractions in the first 1000 expansions have more digits in the numerator than denominator
2. Strategy:
   - Generate the sequence of fractions
   - For each fraction, compare the number of digits in numerator and denominator
   - Count fractions where numerator has more digits
3. Implementation:
   - Use arbitrary-precision arithmetic for large numbers
   - Keep track of numerator and denominator separately
   - Calculate next terms using the pattern of the sequence
4. Optimization:
   - Use recurrence relations to generate terms
   - Compare digit counts without converting to strings
   - Use logarithms to count digits
5. Key points:
   - Need to handle large numbers
   - Need to maintain precision in calculations
   - Look for patterns in the sequence of fractions
