Problem 51: Prime Digit Replacements

By replacing the 1st digit of the 2-digit number *3, it turns out that six of the nine possible values: 13, 23, 43, 53, 73, and 83, are all prime.

By replacing the 3rd and 4th digits of 56**3 with the same digit, this 5-digit number is the first example having seven primes among the ten generated numbers, yielding the family: 56003, 56113, 56333, 56443, 56663, 56773, and 56993. Consequently 56003, being the first member of this family, is the smallest prime with this property.

Find the smallest prime which, by replacing part of the number (not necessarily adjacent digits) with the same digit, is part of an eight prime value family.

Hint:
1. We need to find the smallest prime that can generate 8 primes by replacing some of its digits
2. Strategy:
   - Generate primes in order
   - For each prime, try replacing different combinations of digits
   - Check how many primes are generated by each replacement pattern
3. Implementation:
   - Use a sieve to generate primes
   - For each prime, generate all possible digit replacement patterns
   - Count how many primes are generated by each pattern
4. Optimization:
   - Skip primes that can't be part of an 8-prime family
   - Consider the number of digits to replace
   - Use a set for prime lookups
5. Key points:
   - The replacement digits must be the same
   - The original number must be prime
   - We need exactly 8 primes in the family
   - We want the smallest such prime
