Problem 45: Triangular, Pentagonal, and Hexagonal

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

Triangle	 	Tn=n(n+1)/2	 	1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...
Pentagonal	 	Pn=n(3n−1)/2	 	1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...
Hexagonal	 	Hn=n(2n−1)	 	1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...

It can be verified that T285 = P165 = H143 = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

Hint:
1. We need to find numbers that are simultaneously triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal
2. All hexagonal numbers are also triangular numbers (Hn = T2n-1)
3. Therefore, we only need to find numbers that are both hexagonal and pentagonal
4. Strategy:
   - Generate hexagonal numbers (since they're a subset of triangular numbers)
   - Check if each hexagonal number is also pentagonal
   - Skip the known solution (40755)
5. Optimization:
   - Use the quadratic formula to check if a number is pentagonal
   - Generate hexagonal numbers using the formula Hn = n(2n-1)
   - Start from n=144 since we know H143 = 40755
6. Implementation:
   - Generate hexagonal numbers in order
   - For each hexagonal number, check if it's pentagonal
   - Return the first number after 40755 that satisfies both conditions
