Problem 98: Anagramic Squares

By replacing each of the letters in the word CARE with 1, 2, 9, and 6 respectively, we form a square number: 1296 = 36^2. What is remarkable is that, by using the same digital substitutions, the word RACE also forms a square number: 9216 = 96^2. We shall call CARE (and RACE) a square anagram word pair and specify further that leading zeroes are not permitted, neither may a different letter have the same digital value as another letter.

Using words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English words, find all the square anagram word pairs (a palindromic word is NOT considered to be an anagram of itself).

What is the largest square number formed by any member of such a pair?

Hint:
1. We need to find square anagram word pairs
2. Strategy:
   - Find anagram pairs
   - Generate square numbers
   - Check digit patterns
   - Find largest square
3. Implementation:
   - Word pair finder
   - Square number generator
   - Pattern matcher
   - Digit substitution
4. Optimization:
   - Precompute squares
   - Use efficient anagram detection
   - Filter by word length
   - Cache digit patterns
5. Key points:
   - Anagram word pairs
   - Square numbers
   - Digit substitution
   - No leading zeros
   - Unique digit mapping
