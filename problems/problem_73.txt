Problem 73: Counting Fractions in a Range

Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get:

1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8

It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between 1/3 and 1/2.

How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in the sorted set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 12,000?

Hint:
1. We need to count reduced proper fractions between 1/3 and 1/2 with denominator ≤ 12,000
2. Strategy:
   - Generate fractions in the range
   - Check if each fraction is reduced
   - Count valid fractions
3. Implementation:
   - For each denominator up to 12,000:
     - Find numerators that give fractions in range
     - Check if fraction is reduced using GCD
4. Optimization:
   - Use Farey sequence properties
   - Consider using a tree structure
   - Skip fractions known to be unreduced
5. Key points:
   - Must be between 1/3 and 1/2
   - Need reduced proper fractions
   - Consider mathematical properties
   - Handle large denominators efficiently
