Problem 77: Prime Summations

It is possible to write ten as the sum of primes in exactly five different ways:

7 + 3
5 + 5
5 + 3 + 2
3 + 3 + 2 + 2
2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2

What is the first value which can be written as the sum of primes in over five thousand different ways?

Hint:
1. We need to find the smallest number with over 5000 prime sum combinations
2. Strategy:
   - Generate list of primes
   - Use dynamic programming for sums
   - Count combinations using only primes
3. Implementation:
   - Create sieve for prime generation
   - Build table of prime sum combinations
   - Check each number until target found
4. Optimization:
   - Only generate needed primes
   - Store intermediate results
   - Use partition function properties
5. Key points:
   - Only use prime numbers
   - Need over 5000 combinations
   - Consider order of combinations
   - Use efficient prime generation
