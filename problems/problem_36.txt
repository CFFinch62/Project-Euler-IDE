Problem 36: Double-base Palindromes

The decimal number, 585 = 1001001001 (binary), is palindromic in both bases.

Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in base 10 and base 2.

(Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.)

Hint:
1. Generate all palindromic numbers in base 10 below one million
2. For each palindromic number, convert it to binary
3. Check if the binary representation is also a palindrome
4. Sum all numbers that are palindromic in both bases
5. Note that even numbers can be skipped as their binary representation ends with 0
